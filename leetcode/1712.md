#### Ways to Split Array Into Three Subarrays

<p>Related topics: two pointers, prefix sum array<br>
Time complexity: linear, O(n)</p>

<p>Main ideas:<br>
- We need to find two "walls", so we fix one of the walls and find the other wall.<br>
- Use prefix sum array to make the calculation of partial sums O(1).<br>
- With two pointers, there are two requirements to be fulfilled: prefix_sum[j] - prefix_sum[i] >= prefix_sum[i], and prefix_sum[sz-1] - prefix_sum[k-1] >= prefix_sum[k-1]-prefix_sum[i]</p>
